WooCommerce Cnvrsn Trckng
====================

Forked from the very excellent [WooCommerce Conversion Tracking](https://github.com/tareq1988/woocommerce-conversion-tracking) plugin by [Tareq Hasan](http://tareq.weDevs.com).

This version has a bunch of stuff removed (denoted by also removing most of the vowels in the name), followed by some opinionated changes and restructuring, and hopefully/eventually some small- to medium-sized new features.
